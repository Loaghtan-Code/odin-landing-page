# odin-landing-page
Part of the Odin Project - creating an entire web page from a design provided.

Design is provided from the odin project of what the complete page should look simular to as well as some of the fonts and colours.
- Encouraged to look through notes and to Google for details that have not been covered during the odin project foundations course (Problem solving).
- Try to get the design as close as the the example provided but not to worry about it being pixel perfect.
